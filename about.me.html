  <h1>About me</h1>
   <h2><p>â€œI am Rishab, I live in the city of historical significance, Delhi.<br/>
    I am a student at the Krishna Public school, studying in standard six.<br/>
     In our family, we are two siblings. I have a younger sister.<br/>
     Our family consists of my sister, my father, my loving mother, and my grandparents.<br/>
     My father is a scientist whereas my mother is a schoolteacher.<br/></h2>

  <h2> <br/> I am studying in one of the reputed schools in Delhi, which has always fed me<br/>
    to be motivated towards the future.<br/>
    All of my virtues have been incorporated in me by my school and helping is one of them.<br/>
    My school always aims at the holistic development of a student and it focuses on the fact<br/>
    that we develop both morally as well as academically.<br/>
     It is always a part of learning that you try to inculcate virtues in yourself by being<br/>
    an honest person.  To be responsible and to adhere to your duties, is what our school teachers us.</p></h2>
